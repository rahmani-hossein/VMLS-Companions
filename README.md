# recommendation system project
it's for one of my lessons(applied linear algebra)that was based on the book below(i forked the repository in this repository). the method was implemented with new programming language julia. (in the recommender.ipynb)


# VMLS-Python-and-Julia-Companion
*This is a companion to the Julia companion for:
"Vectors, Matrices, and Least Squares" by Boyd and Vandenberghe. Which you can find here: http://vmls-book.stanford.edu/.

You can find notebooks with implementations in both Python and Julia that are direct references to the companion.

This is best perused in conjunction to the first degree companion: http://vmls-book.stanford.edu/vmls-julia-companion.pdf.

You can also find a Python companion put together by Leung and Matyspura here: https://ses.library.usyd.edu.au/handle/2123/21370

To run Julia in a jupyter kernel, Julia offers documentation here: https://pkg.julialang.org/docs/IJulia/nfu7T/1.9.3/. Also note that if you use `brew` as a primary package manager connected to your kernels, it will automatically setup the kernel for you when you run `brew cask install julia`.
